        <tr> <td align="left"> <p>these are stray cats must be of fifth or sixth generation,
          each new generation comes after three to four years,
          They roam from one house to another in the neighborhood, 
          if they feel hungry, they know our timing of lunch and dinner, 
          sometime if they don’t get anything to eat some were else they will come at any time 
          and will ask for food with continuous  loud meow sound.</p> <p>
          Though this is fifth generation, 
          we do not see increase in the population of stray cats in our neighborhood, 
          we have seen litter of two to four, of each generation, 
          may be it is nature’s way to keep check on population, 
          our guess is since they move from one home to another, 
          some time they get killed by vehicles, another guess is some stray dogs must be killing them.
          Or they must be moving to new territory
